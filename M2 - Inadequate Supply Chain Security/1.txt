com.android.support:support-v4 (v19.1.0-v28.0.0)

Similar to AppCompat, this library version has a vulnerability in TextUtils.htmlEncode() which could lead to HTML injection attacks.

org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient (v4.3.0-v4.3.6)

These versions of the library are susceptible to the BEAST attack when using SSLv3.

com.google.android.gms:play-services (v11.0.0-v15.0.1)

Some versions of the Google Play Services library have been found to have vulnerabilities in the LocationClient class, which could allow attackers to track users' locations.

com.android.volley:volley (v1.0.0-v1.1.0)
